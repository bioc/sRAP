Description: This package provides a pipeline for gene expression analysis (primarily for RNA-Seq data).  The normalization function is specific for RNA-Seq analysis, but all other functions (Quality Control Figures, Differential Expression and Visualization, and Functional Enrichment via BD-Func) will work with any type of gene expression data.
