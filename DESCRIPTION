Description: This package provides a pipeline for gene expression
        analysis (primarily for RNA-Seq data).  The normalization
        function is specific for RNA-Seq analysis, but all other
        functions (Quality Control Figures, Differential Expression and
        Visualization, and Functional Enrichment via BD-Func) will work
        with any type of gene expression data.
